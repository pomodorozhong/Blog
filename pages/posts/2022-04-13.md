# Your app is the byproduct of your process

I believe it also applies to programming an app.

So, rather than making an app as perfect as possible upfront, I am aiming for forging a great process.

## What makes a great process?

I'm only starting to figure it out, just [weeks ago I was still being forced on others' processes](./2022-04-05).

For the time being, I got some guesses:

- Iterating the MVP
- Building **actual** reusable components
- Minimal but crucial unit-testing
- Proper tooling

## Isn't it "Yak Shaving"?

It may be, but I don't think that's really a bad thing.

Slack, the popular messaging app, was [came out of a yak shaving](https://nira.com/slack-history/). The team focused on improving their internal communication, and they did get a great product.

It may not be THE product they initially expected, but it's A product we all enjoy.
